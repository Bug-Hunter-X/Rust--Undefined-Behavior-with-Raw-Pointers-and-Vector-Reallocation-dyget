This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in Rust related to undefined behavior when using raw pointers with dynamically sized data structures like vectors. The `bug.rs` file contains the problematic code, which modifies a vector via a raw pointer without accounting for potential reallocations. The `bugSolution.rs` file showcases a safer approach, emphasizing the use of safe abstractions over raw pointers whenever possible. This example highlights the importance of understanding memory management and avoiding potential undefined behavior in Rust.
